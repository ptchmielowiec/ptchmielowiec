Welcome to My GIS Island! üåç

About Me

- :wave: Hello there! I'm Piotr, a GIS specialist with a passion for open-source solutions and building innovative GIS enterprise architectures. I have extensive experience working on large-scale, multinational projects, where I leverage my skills to analyze and visualize geographic data using the latest technologies. My GIS journey started at the University of Science and Technology in Cracow, where I graduated with honors from the Faculty of Geology, Geophysics, and Environmental Protection. My dedication and hard work were recognized with the prestigious honorary saber of SITPNiG, making me the best graduate of my faculty in 2021.

- :pushpin: QGIS - When it comes to GIS mapping, my heart belongs to QGIS. If I had to choose one software to use for the rest of my life, it would undoubtedly be QGIS.

- :elephant: PostgreSQL with PostGIS - For managing geospatial data, PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension is my top choice. I believe that most of us start our database journey with relational databases, then venture into the endless realm of NoSQL databases, only to eventually realize that PostgreSQL is the real OG!

- :computer: Solid.js/ Docker/ Postgraphile - In the world of web development, I'm a firm believer in the K.I.S.S. principle (keep it simple, stupid). That's why my go-to tech stack is TypeScript with Solid.js and Hasura running on Docker. With this approach, I can develop full-stack apps capable of running on cost-effective servers in a very short period of time.

- :clock5: Apart from my GIS pursuits, I have a soft spot for martial arts, especially Judo. I managed my University Judo team for over 5 years and trained and competed until injuries prompted me to transition to Jujitsu, which I equally enjoy. Besides that, I am a big enthusiast of natural mineral water springs. Each year, I spend a few weeks traveling across Poland, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic with the goal of tasting and documenting all of them.

- üì´ I'm excited to collaborate, share knowledge, and contribute to meaningful projects within the geospatial community. If you share similar interests or have exciting opportunities, feel free to connect with me.

Thanks for stopping by! üôå
